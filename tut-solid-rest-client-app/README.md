## installation
`npx degit solidjs/templates/ts tut-solid-rest-client-app`

## run
```
npm install # or yarn or pnpm
npm run dev # or yarn or pnpm
```
## Usage

Those templates dependencies are maintained via [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) via `pnpm up -Lri`.

This is the reason you see a `pnpm-lock.yaml`. That being said, any package manager will work. This file can be safely be removed once you clone a template.

```bash
$ npm install # or pnpm install or yarn install
```
